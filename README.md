# tomat

### A bash script to run a pomodoro timer in the terminal.

  The timer runs six pomodoro sessions of 25 minutes with 5 minute breaks between them except for after the third session which is followed by a longer fifteen minute break.

  Currently this works for me. Self-serving I know. ;-)


### About
