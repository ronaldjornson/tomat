# tomat

### A bash script to run a pomodoro timer in the terminal.

  The timer runs six pomodoro sessions of 25 minutes with 5 minute breaks between them except for after the third session which is followed by a longer fifteen minute break.

  Currently this works for me. Self-serving I know. ;-)


### About
  
  Tomat is danish (my mother's tongue) for tomato or in italian pomodoro.


### TODO

  The script is long and ugly with many repeats. I am using this project as a learning experience and will clean up the script in due course.
